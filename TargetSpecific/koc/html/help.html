						<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
						<p align="justify">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you move the mouse you’ll notice a small fly buzzing around. When Pinky can't decide what to do next, move the fly to one of his ''thought balloons'' and double tap the screen.  Choose quickly or he will make up his own mind. And remember, every decision you make will affect the characters in that episode! Sometimes Pinky will think about drawing his gun. When the gun appears, move the mouse to aim and press the button if you decide to fire. Don't move the cursor too quickly and be sure to stay on your toes, you never know what the other characters will do.
						</p>
						<h2>Drive-by Bombings</h2>
						<p align="justify">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful demolition requires a steady hand and careful timing. As the car drives by the front of the building, press the Ieft mouse button to Iob the bomb. The Ionger you hold your finger on the button the higher the bomb travels. Your aim is based entirely on when you throw the bomb, and not on the position of your cursor.
						</p>
						<h2>Decisions</h2>
						<p align="justify">
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of your decisions will cause branches in the game while others affect the personalities of the characters involved in that particular scene. For example, making a caustic remark to Lola will boost Pinky's toughness but decrease Lola's happiness. (And if she gets too unhappy-well, watch out! Conversely, the boys are more Iikely to mutiny with a weak Ieader; it's a very delicate balance.)
						</p>
						<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
						<p align="left"><b>Why did my losses go down when I adjusted the salaries?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Losses are based on the monthly income minus the salaries you are about to pay out. Whenever you open the Iedger, think of it as payday!</p>
						<p align="left"><b>Do I ever want my monthly income to be less?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Your income producing ventures can only yield so much. If you push them too hard they might become unproductive. Also, the more effort you put into one area the Iess energy and resources you’ll have for another.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>How many ways are there to win the game?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at Ieast three completely different ways to win The King of Chicago. So keep playing!</p>
						<p align="left"><b>Why did I Iose men after a shootout with Santucci?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you get into a gun battle with the Southside gang you risk Iosing a few men. Every time you allow them to get a shot off, you Iose a valuable gang member. If there are no more men Ieft in the gang, the next shot will kill Pinky.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>Is there a secret to blowing away the Old Man in his car?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>Will the game play by itself?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Unless you pull down the intermission option the game will take off by itself, (until you do something) making random decisions along the way. So if you pause too Iong, you may find that the computer takes you off to see Lola, or it might even open the Iedger. So keep on your toes and keep moving!</p>
						<p align="left"><b>Why do l keep getting attacked as I head off on a raid?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Pinky Ieaves in his car he runs the risk of being followed and attacked by one of Santucci's hoodlum pals. Your odds of being ambushed increase immediately following a successful raid, so it's sometimes helpful to Iay Iow for a turn or two.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>What happens if I pull my gun on someone but don't shoot?</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's only one way to find out. The best part about The King of Chicago is that it's full of surprises. So turn down the Iights, pop up some popcorn grab a soda and enjoy!</p>
						<h2>Real Gangsters</h2>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's go back in time to 12:01 a.m. on January 17, 1920. A nation victorious in war and steeped in idealism embarked on what must be one of history's dumbest effort ever to outlaw sin. It was popularly called the Volstead Act, after a well-intentioned Congressman of the day, and its purpose was to pro-hibit the manufacture, importation, sale and consumption of booze.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Chicago back in 1920 was Big Jim Colosimo, a crafty old rascal who owned the cops, the courts, the politicians, and a one-stop shopping center of vice called Colisimo's Cafe on South Wabash Avenue. Despite excited talk of Prohibition opportunities, Big Jim was happy the way things were. He'd fallen madly in love with a 19 year old aspiring opera singer named Dale, who could think of worse fates than wealth. For her, he left his frumpy wife, started polishing his speech and his manners, and eventually brought in his punk nephew from New York, Johnny Torrio, to tend shop while he devoted all his efforts to sex and self-improvement.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine, except that Torrio was a man of youth, energy and vision who recognized the wonderful opportunities presented by National Prohibition. That Big Jim couldn't care less presented a problem, but not one lacking a solution. Torrio brought in his own right-hand man, Alphonse Capone, another Brooklyn transplant, who had been policikng the Colosimo chain of brothels and other-wise making himself useful. For months the two tried to reason with the old man, but he remained adamantly opposed to any added responsibilities that might cut intohis love life. Too bad.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of March 20, 1920, an unidentified gunman in the vestibule of Colosimo's nightclub fired a pistol shot that sent the King up to that big pleasure palace in the sky.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE KING IS DEAD! LONG LIVE THE KING! The NEW King that is, Johnny Torrio, ably assisted by brothel bouncer Al, whose paycheck began a meteoric rise from a measly $75 to $2,000 a week by 1922. Torrio was not alone, of course, in recognizing the bountiful rewards that could be reaped from the illegl sale of alchohol. All over the city, street gangs and "social clubs" were discovering that the very fact of being organized permitted a certain amount of profitable mischief--everything from terrorizing unsympathetic voters on behalf of crooked aldermen to shaking down shopkeepers. What better base on which to build a criminal business enterprise?</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, the demand for illegal booze so outstripped the supply that the various gangs were able to operate in their respective territories without stepping on one another's toes. But the farsighted Torrio knew this couldn't last and (such was his authority as the reigning King of Chicago) he convened a summit meeting that formally carved up Chicago into independent fiefdoms. He and Capone kept the near South Side; the classy North Side went to ward-politician and erstwhile florist Dion O'Banion. A number of smaller gangs subordinated their ethnic rivalries to respect each other's turfs and even cooperated, one handling, say, the alchohol distillng (in which immigrant Sicilian families specialized, whether they wanted to or not) and another the beer-running, with trade agreements between them.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 10, 1924, Torrio sent three men to O'Banion's flower shop, ostensibly to buy a floral tribute to a fallen comrade. One took the Irishman's hand in a clasp of friendship (preventing him from reaching a gun) and the other two blasted him six times in what became known as the infamous "handshake murder."</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming control of the North Siders was one irate and vengeful Hymie Weiss whose gunmen, two months later, pumped several bullets into Torrio but failed to kill him. It was enough, however, that Johnny got religion. He took his money and abdicated to New York, leaving the throne to Al Capone.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the middle of 1925 the fighting had become routine. This was the beginning of the "Battle of Chicago," and in searching for ways to increase their offensive capabilities gang tacticians discovered the Thompson submachine gun. It was a weapon that would alter beer-war combat the way football was revolutionized by the forward pass. There was also a bonus feature: While Chicago and other cities were clamping down on the sale of concealable weapons--namely handguns--the Thompson did not legally fit that definition. And since machine guns before that time were large contraptions of no  interest to criminals, no one had thought to prohibit them. Thus, you might not be able to buy a pistol without a lot of trouble and red tape, but you could walk into a well-stocked sporting goods store, plunk down $175 and walk out with a Thompson submachine gun.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Saltis-McErlane gang introduced the Thompson to modern criminal warfare but proved embarassingly inept with it. Capone, meanwhile, had acquired some of his own and quickly demonstrated that he had the touch. Unfortunately for Capone, submachine guns aren't too specific and one of his victims turned out to be William McSwiggin, a well-known assistant state's attorney newspapers called "the hanging prosecutor".  Why McSwiggen was consorting with bootleg-gers was never to be explained, but the resulting uproar forced the police to raid Capone's new headquarters at Cicero's Hawthorne Hotel where they seized ledgers that would one day contribute to his undoing.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommyguns and Chicago gangsters were just about synonymous and the gun had acquired such nicknames as the "Chicago Piano" and the "Chicago Typewriter". Even when called just plain "chopper" it was still considered a Chicago gangster weapon, and if there was any doublt on that point, it vanished on February 14, 1929. St. Valentines Day!</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Capone had performed some artful machine-gunnings in the past, the project he had in mind now would be a mural by comparison. It was a sting, of sorts. A truckload of Old Log Cabin whiskey, supposedly hijacked from Capone, was sold to the North Side at an irresistible price and a second truckload was to be delivered to a booze depot called the S.M.C. Cartage Company at 2122 North Clark Street. About 10:30 on that fateful Thursday morning two men dressed in Chicago cop uniforms, followed by two in overcoats, walked into the building and hosed down the seven North Siders inside with a pair of Thompsons. Then they walked back out to a waiting car, of the type used by Chicago police, and drove off.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago was mortified. The police, who had yet to solve a gangland murder, went into fits of futile investigation. Even citizens who had come to view the back-and-forth warfare between Capone and the North Siders like an underworld series were wondering if mass murder wasn't a bit much. The publisher of the "Chicago Daily News" personally led a mission to the White House in Washington to demand federal intervention.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As these problems mounted, and with the North Siders apoplectic for revenge, Capone decided the safest place to be was a jail cell in a distant city and deliberately got himself arrested in Philadelphia on a gun-carrying charge.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the real disaster struck. On Octover 24, 1931, Capone suffered the everlasting humiliation of being convicted for a non-violent crime....failure to pay his taxes. In shame, he was sentenced to 11 years and shipped off to the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, then transferred to Alcatraz just to make the Government look good.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Broad Shoulders was left in desperate need of a stylish, charismatic, and resolute man of Mr. Capone's...ah...caliber.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no denying that Scarface Al Capone is a tough act to follow. But here's your chance to give it a try...</p>
						<h2>The Scenario</h2>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of Chicaog is an interactive movie that takes you back in time, allowing you tore-write history. The story begins with the fall of Chicago Kingpin, Al Capone, who has just left for an eleven year Alcatraz vacation package, leaving his Southside gane in the grip of devious and dangerous Tony Santucci.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You star in the role of PINKY CALLAHAN, a rising mug in the opposing Northside organization. Pinky's tired of the bloody civil war. He wants to force those Southside S.O.B.s out of business and gain total control of the Windy City. Pinky wants to be THE KING OF CHICAGO...and he'll stop at nothing to get it!</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Pinky is two heads down on the shaky Northside totem pole. First, he'll have to get rid of the OLD MAN, a crusty old hood who led the gang to defeat during the Capone wars. BEN is the Old Man's chief advisor and stands next in line to fill the vacancy, but Pinky figures he'll step aside...with a little persuasion.</p>
						<h2>The Movie</h2>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action begins in 1931 and ends in 1934, the year leaders of organize crime held a meeting in New York City to form the national Syndicate. Murder Inc. was established to centralize violence and keep it out of the hands of individual gangs.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago was considered too barbaric to be admitted as a voting member of the Syndicate.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's your chance to re-write history. You have three years to establish such a commanding position in Chicago that gang wars are a thing ofthe past. If you succeed, an invitation to join the syndicate will be forwarded from New York. The full weight of organized crime will secure your position as the reigning KING OF CHICAGO!</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE KING OF CHICAGO is primarily a contest of strategy, both on a territorial and a social level. The personality of your character, and the characters you interact with, will change slightly EVERY time you make a decision. Playing it cool with Lola, for example, will raise your toughness. Threats will become more effective. Gang loyalty will usually go up.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lola's happiness will plummet, and that may leave her open to the advances of your archrival Tony Santucci. Your image will be tarnished. The gang may lose respect.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, you have no friends. and even your allies can turn on you like mad dogs. Learn to use the tools of your trade: violence, threats, bribery, influence, leadership, betrayal, and above all savvy-the knowledge of when to use each tool to its best effect.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money can buy loyalty, sometimes. But once you open the well you'd better make sure there's a steady flow.</p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you stand with the other gang members? Is Ben with you or against you? You'd better find out.</p>
						<h2>The Players</h2>
						<p align="left"><b>You play the part of PINKY CALLAHAN</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinky is smart, good looking, very ambitious... a high roller. He hates the name "Pinky". Begins some contests with a reputation for toughness. Sometimes he is a wimp. He's mixed up with a fiery little hellcat names Lola. Not the kind of girl you want to take home to mother. Loves his Monna but she can't accept the life her boy has chosen to lead. Has a soft spot for his childhood friend, Tom Malone, who is now a cop. Pinky will lie, kill, and double-cross to get to the top. Plans to take control of Chicago by 1934. Figures he'll join the Syndicate to secure his empire.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>BEN</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crafty, devious. More intelligent than ambitious. Has been with the Northside for years. CAN be a good advisor if he's treated well. Treat him badly and he can arrange to have your throat cut. Doesn't really like violence and is a coward in action. LOOKS tough though, and won't hesitate to make threats.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>OLD MAN</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never much of a leader. Capone ground him into the dirt like an old cigar butt. He's weak and cautious from a career of watching the Southside gang roll over his Northside. Too old to take advantage of the termporary turmoil created by Capone's departure. Sometimes he can be talked into retirement. Sometimes he'll fight your attempted coup like the plague. Considers Ben his rightful heir.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>LOLA</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitchy, flashy...typical gangster moll. Wants to be a singer. Has big ambitions for Pinky but she fights with him constantly. Claims he doesn't spend enough time with her...or money ON her. Can be dangerous if mistreated. On the other hand, if Pinky lays down for her the gang may decide to elect a leader with more backbone. Aney they vote with their bullets.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>BULL</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thickheaded thug with a heart of, if not solid gold, at least PLATED gold. He's loyal to whoever is in power. Loves following orders but doesn't enjoy killing. Apologizes to anyone he has to bump off.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>TOM MALONE</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Boy Scout with a badge. Rests his cap on a golden halo. Grew up with Pinky but won't bend the law for him. Likes to think of himself as a human vacuum cleaner, sucking up the dirt of humanity.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>PEEPERS</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Northside boys. Likes to complain. May have to be watched. He likees to hang around with Bull and may have some influence on him. Sometimes he will back the Old Man at the beginning of the game. Sometimes he won't.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>TONY SANTUCCI</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony is Capone's heir. He's devious. Despicable. And one mean S.O.B. He isn't as generous as Capone, nor is he as good at PR. Tries to centralize power in his own hands and this leaves openings for expanding the Northside turf. He's tricky in business dealings but this can be used against him.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>GUIDO</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony's sidekick. Nervous, trigger-happy, a clod. He's the Southside YES man. Unfortunately, it's about the only word in his vocabulary. COULD play a major role in Tony's fall from power.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>JAKE</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mystery man. Plays many different roles. Sometimes he's a hired gun. Sometimes he only has a minor part. No political ties to North or South.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>MOMMA</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weepy and moralistic. She loves her son but hates his career. She appears in vignettes trying to get Pinky to leave the gang. Considers Tom Malone a shining example of rectitude. Pinky tries to bluff her about his crookedness but she sees through it.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>ALDERMAN BURKE</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corrupt Westside ward boss. Helps keep the Northside boys out of jail unless they were arrested by Southside cops. Could be a valuable property at election time.</p>
						<p align="left"><b>ANDY, THE KID</b></p>
						<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright, ambitious 13-year old from a poor family. He idolizes Pinky and likes to hang around at headquarters. Tom Malone may ask Pinky to turn the kid away from crime.</p>
